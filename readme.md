## Volleyball Scoreboard
This project is meant to help Canal Vienne build an identity for the volleyball team of Vienne. Canal Vienne is broadcasting their games and was willing to improve the design of the scoreboard.

The website in itself is not made to be displayed through a regular browser, but instead through a browser element from OBS in order to be shown during broadcasts.
